Document Outline
1. Introduction
Importance of properly structured pages


Benefits of semantic structure:


Convey meaning via markup


Better accessibility


Easier indexing and search


Easier content repurposing


Consideration of diverse user agents (devices, robots, etc.)


Consequences of inconsistent or non-semantic structure


2. Sectioning Elements
Purpose of sectioning to add meaning and organize content


Common page regions and their semantic containers:


Introductory information


Page navigation


Main content


Sidebar/related information


Evolution of sectioning:


Pre-HTML5: reliance on heading tags and divs with classes/IDs


HTML5: introduction of semantic elements for common page sections


Key HTML5 sectioning elements:


<aside>, <article>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <nav>, <section>


Guidelines:


Choosing appropriate elements is often a judgment call


Ensuring the final structure reflects the desired document outline


3. Document Outlines
Concept of the document outline as a summary or table of contents


Role of outlines in:


Searching documents quickly


Improving navigation, especially for assistive technologies


Historical approach:


Pre-HTML5 outlines based on heading tags (H1-H6)


Importance of heading strategy for consistent structure


HTML5 outline algorithm:


Integration of new sectioning elements with headings


More sophisticated outline model



4. W3C Warning on HTML5 Outline Algorithm
Status of implementation:


No known implementation in browsers or assistive tech


Implemented in some tools like conformance checkers


Recommendation:


Do not rely solely on the outline algorithm for structure


Use heading ranks (H1-H6) to convey document structure


5. WAI-ARIA Roles
Role of WAI-ARIA in enhancing accessibility beyond HTML structure


Definition of WAI-ARIA:


Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification


Purpose of roles attribute:


Assign predefined roles to content


Help assistive devices understand content type, relationships, and interactivity


Importance of combining semantic HTML with ARIA roles


Reference to W3C resource on WAI-ARIA usage


6. Conclusion
Recap of the importance of semantic structure for meaning and accessibility


Emphasis on consistent use of sectioning elements and headings


Encouragement to use WAI-ARIA roles appropriately for accessibility
